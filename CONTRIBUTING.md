# Contributing

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

We're glad you're interested in contributing to yapt! As this is a small
project, it's pretty informal, but here are our requests.

## Please be kind.

We welcome everyone's ideas contribution no matter their
background or experience in the technology stack. Help make this a safe,
supportive, and fun place to collaborate.

## PRs welcome

If you notice something minor (e.g. a small bug or typo,) please
feel free to submit a PR. If it's something largerâ€”perhaps something that
you'll spend more than an hour onâ€”please open an issue first, to discuss the
work and get consensus before putting a considerable amount of coding time into
it.

## Tests optional (for now) 

While we love testing and TDD here, this project is
still in the side-project/prototyping phase. If you want to write tests, please
use the built in Jest testing tools in CRA.
